# GRASP Algorithm in Julia

# You already have the problem loaded with C, A
# We'll reuse the `greedy`, `deepest_d`, and other helper functions you defined.

    # Solutions set to store the best solutions found
    solutions = []
    best_solution = []
    best_value = -Inf

        # Step 1: Greedy Randomized Construction Phase
        initial_solution = greedy(C, A)
        println("Initial solution: ", initial_solution)

        # Step 2: Local Search Phase
        improved_solution, improved_value = deepest_d(initial_solution)

    # You could add some post-optimization steps here if needed

    # Step 4: Return the best solution
